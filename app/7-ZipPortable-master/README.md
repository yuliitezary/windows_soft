## Features

* Runs the full 7-Zip file/archive manager.
* Completely portable - runs off a USB, cloud drive (DropBox, iCloud drive,
  OneDrive, etc) or hard drive.
* No need for any external software - simply download extract and run!
* Packaged in PortableApps.com format for easy integration.
* Associations are supported and easily customizable.
> To add your own file associations, open the `7-ZipPortable.ini` file. Under `[Associations]` add any extension you wish to support. For example:
> ```INI
> [Associations]
> 1=7z
> 2=001
> 3=rar
> 4=zip
> ```
> For a list of all supported filetypes, open `AppInfo.ini` and review the `[Associations]Filetypes` key. 
> 
> **Note**:
> - Adding a lot of extensions can and will effect launch time. 
> - Windows XP tends to cache icon resources which are inevitably visible even after exiting 7-Zip.
> - Windows 8 can be problematic and may require unlocking for some filetypes&mdash;_i.e._ when double-clicking on a supported file format and Windows asks you to select 7-Zip from a list. This is because Windows 8 has an implementation of a hash ID for associations. 
> - Do not associate through 7-Zip! This will leave trash in the registry when you exit the program. 
* SendTo is also available for any filetypes that aren't associated but are supported for use with 7-Zip.
* Added ability to use shell extension/context menu features. See user configuration file to enable. Do not enable this feature through 7-Zip!
* The user configuration file includes the following optional settings:
> ```INI
> [7-ZipPortable]
> AdditionalParameters=
> ShellExtension=true
> RunLocally=false
> USBDevice=false
> Banner=false
> ```
> - AdditionalParameters: Pass additional command-line switches.
> - ShellExtension: (`true`, `false`, `auto`) Enable/disable Shell Extension/Context Menu features. Requires administrative rights.
> - RunLocally: (`true`/`false`) Application is copied to and executed from `%TEMP%` directory.
> - USBDevice: (`true`/`false`) Enable to prevent ejection/unplugging problems with removable devices. When `ShellExtension` is enabled, Windows Explorer tends to lock application's DLL(s). If enabled, PAF will ensure DLL(s) are unlocked.
> - Banner: (`true`/`false`) Enable/disable initialization banner.
* More features soon to come!
